### Branching Strategy
I will be using a feature branching strategy in all my projects to effectivly implement version control on my code changes with the following branches:
+ Main(Master)
+ Develop
+ Feature branches 

### The use of a .gitignore file
The .gitignore file will be used to tell Git which files should be ignored in my projects to ensure that certain files will not be tracked by Git, this file will be updated with every project.

### Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Credentials and sensitive information will not be stored in the repositories and if there has to be credentials and sensitive information in the code I will make use of the Git_Secrets tool to prevent this information from getting forked with the rest of the code.
